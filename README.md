# v_dialog demo

very ***early*** demo/p.o.c for a pure v-ui dialog module.

Currently only tested on Windows 10.0.18363, v-ui (3f730e4), v (136c469)

this was really just me messing around with v-ui for the first time. so there's no real hacks or anything yet.
I don't have any context switching setup aside from windows being generated and destroyed as needed.
